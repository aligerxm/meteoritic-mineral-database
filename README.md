# Meteoritic Mineral Database

An open-source, collaborative database for meteoritic minerals, designed to facilitate research and data sharing among mineralogists, planetary scientists, and the broader scientific community.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized, version-controlled collection of detailed mineral entries discovered in meteorites. Each entry follows a standardized template, ensuring consistency and ease of comparison. The database aims to:

- Provide a transparent record of meteoritic mineral discoveries.
- Enable community contributions and corrections.
- Offer a reliable reference for researchers, educators, and enthusiasts.
- Support open science by linking to primary publications and analytical data.

## Audience

- **Mineralogists** studying extraterrestrial materials.
- **Planetary scientists** investigating the formation and evolution of solar-system bodies.
- **Curators and collectors** of meteorites.
- **Students and educators** seeking authoritative examples.
- **Data scientists** interested in structured mineralogical data.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community. To add a new mineral or update an existing entry, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes (e.g., `feature/add-new-mineral`).
3. **Copy the template** [`MINERAL_TEMPLATE.md`](MINERAL_TEMPLATE.md) and rename it to the mineral's name (lowercase, `.md` extension).
4. **Fill in the template** with accurate, cited information.
5. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message.
6. **Open a Pull Request** (PR) against the `main` branch of this repository.
7. **Reference any related issues** in the PR description (e.g., "Closes #123").

Each PR will be reviewed by project maintainers for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the template. Once approved, it will be merged and become part of the official database.

## Mineral Entry Template

The [`MINERAL_TEMPLATE.md`](MINERAL_TEMPLATE.md) file defines the required structure for all mineral entries. Please use it as a starting point for any new contributions.
