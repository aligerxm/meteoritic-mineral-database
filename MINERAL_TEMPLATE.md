# Mineral Entry Template

Use this template for all new mineral entries in the Meteoritic Mineral Database. Copy this file, rename it to the mineral's name (lowercase with `.md` extension), and fill in the placeholders with accurate, cited information.

---

## Mineral Name
*Replace with the approved mineral name (e.g., Wassonite)*

## IMA Number
*Replace with the International Mineralogical Association (IMA) number, if assigned (e.g., 2011-011)*

## Chemical Formula
*Replace with the ideal chemical formula (e.g., TiS)*

## Crystal System & Structure
*Replace with the crystal system (e.g., Tetragonal) and a brief description of the structure (e.g., Layered structure with Ti–S bonds).*

## Discovery Meteorite
*Replace with the name of the meteorite where the mineral was first identified (e.g., Yamato 691 enstatite chondrite). Include fall/find location and classification if known.*

## Year of Discovery
*Replace with the year the mineral was discovered (e.g., 2011).*

## Key Publications
*Replace with a bulleted list of the most relevant publications (journal articles, conference abstracts, etc.) that report the discovery or provide critical analytical data. Include DOIs or other persistent identifiers where possible.*

- *First report: Author et al., *Journal Name* **Year**, Volume, Pages. DOI: [10.xxxx/xxxxx](https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx)*
- *Structural refinement: Author et al., *Journal Name* **Year**, Volume, Pages. DOI: [10.xxxx/xxxxx](https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx)*
- *Additional context: Author et al., *Journal Name* **Year**, Volume, Pages. DOI: [10.xxxx/xxxxx](https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx)*

## Notes on Analysis
*Replace with a brief summary of the analytical techniques used to characterize the mineral (e.g., "Identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron‑diffraction patterns; composition determined by energy‑dispersive X‑ray spectroscopy (EDS)."). Mention any unique features or challenges.*

## Contributing Scientist(s)
*Replace with the names and affiliations of the scientists who contributed the data for this entry (optional but encouraged).*

## Last Updated
*Replace with the date this entry was last reviewed or updated (YYYY‑MM‑DD format).*
