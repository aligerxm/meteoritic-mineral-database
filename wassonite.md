## Mineral Name
Wassonite

## IMA Number
2011‑011

## Chemical Formula
TiS (titanium sulfide)

## Crystal System & Structure
Tetragonal, space group *P4/nmm*. The structure consists of layered Ti–S sheets with Ti atoms in a square‑planar coordination and S atoms in a tetrahedral coordination. The layers are stacked along the *c* axis.

## Discovery Meteorite
Yamato 691 enstatite chondrite (find location: Yamato Mountains, Antarctica; classification: EH3 enstatite chondrite).

## Year of Discovery
2011 (approved by the IMA in 2011).

## Notes on Analysis
Wassonite was identified and characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with selected‑area electron diffraction (SAED). Its chemical composition was verified by energy‑dispersive X‑ray spectroscopy (EDS). The mineral occurs as sub‑micrometer‑sized grains (typically <1 µm) intergrown with other sulfide phases. The crystal‑structure solution was obtained from high‑resolution TEM images and diffraction patterns.
